# Autoscaling-analyser

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyse auto-scaling strategies based on the
ADI metric proposed by Marco A. S. Netto on the "Evaluating Auto-scaling Strategies for Cloud Computing Environments" article. The implementation was developed based on the rules and parameters of the article.

### Auto-scaling Demand Index

The Auto-scaling Demand Index (ADI) as quoted by Marcos 

> "is the sum of all distances computed between each utilisation level reported by the system and the target utilisation interval set by the user. [...] ADI is convenient because it employs the same metric to evaluate (or, more precisely, penalise) both
unacceptable QoS and resource underutilisation."

### Installation

You can install R software for free [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

We recommend you to use [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
which has all the tools you need to develop using R.

Install the following library dependencies, on R console:
```
> install.packages("dplyr", "testthat")
```
Or you can install under the "packages" tab on R Studio.

### Usage

The [main.R](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/autoscaling-analyser/blob/main/src/main.R) file is where you want to start playing with the algorithm. 
You can add new data files, or you can use the one that we offer as sample: 
[decreasing_data.csv](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/autoscaling-analyser/blob/main/data/decreasing_data.csv)

You can run the script on your terminal on the repo root directory, with the following command:
```
$ Rscript src/main.R data/$input_data
```
Where the second argument is the path to the data file.

This will output the ADI on your terminal, the response will look like this:
```
[1] 414.3679
```
In addition, an output file is also generated which will be stored under the
``/output`` directory.

The output file will contain a table with the following columns:

- **timestamp**: Timestamp column from input data.
- **Cores**: Demanded cores for an application (Cores column from input data).
- **ExceededCores**: Amount of cores that is not supported by the allocated
infrastructure.
- **SystemUtilization**: Percentage of demanded cores over allocated cores.
- **AllocatedCores**: Actual allocated cores in the infrastructure.
- **NewCores**: New cores with will be allocated on the next timestamp to meet
the current system utilization requirement. It's value can be either zero, 
the step size or -1 multiplied by the step size.
- **OverUtilization**: Percentage of demanded cores over exceeded cores.
- **ADI**: ADI metric on each timestamp.

### Configuration file

Under the root directory there is a configuration file with the following parameters:

- **Initial allocated cores**: the amount of cores available initially for your application
to run. During the simulation, the auto scaling algorithm will increase or decrease
this value, based on the boundaries that you set.
- **Scheduling**: cron configurations for when to increase or decrease the capacity of the application.
- **Lower bound**: The minimum utilization level percentage of your application's cores
- **Upper bound**: The maximum utilization level percentage of your application's cores
- **Step size**: The amount of cores you want to add or remove on each auto scaling operation.

### Data files

You can add more data files to calculate the ADI, storing them on the data
directory.
The file has to be in csv format and is composed of two columns: Cores and timestamp.
Every line of the Cores column is filled with floating numbers,
representing the amount of cores used by a given application in each timestamp.
The timestamp date format is currently up to you, since isn't not used yet by
the algorithm, but it's useful for reference.

| timestamp   | Cores     |
|:------------|:----------| 
| 1617228000  | 12.22     | 
| 1617228060  | 10.10     |   
| 1617228120  | 8.64      |    
| ...         | ...       |
