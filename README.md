### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to implement and simulate auto-scaling policies.  
So far, the simulator has the Simple Scaling and Target Tracking policies from AWS implemented.

### Installation

You can install R software for free [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

We recommend you to use [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
which has all the tools you need to develop using R.

Install the following library dependencies, on R console:
```
> install.packages("dplyr", "testthat", "yaml", "yardstick", "R.utils", "purrr", "reticulate")
```
Or you can install under the "packages" tab on R Studio.

You also need [croniter](), which is a python package and is installed as follows:
```
$ pip install croniter
```

### Usage

You can run the script on your terminal on the repo root directory, with the following command:
```
$ Rscript src/main.R
```
This will run the simulator with the parameters set on the config file.
If you want to use another config file just pass the config file path on
the second argument like this:
```
$ Rscript src/main.R $config_filepath
```

As a result, output file(s) will be generated based on your config settings.
